I watch video "Allen Rabinovich: The Many Hats of the Frontend Engineer" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDRr_pUl3i0).
I think, I like all these hats:
#1 the hat of an engineer,
#2 the hat of an anthropologist,
#3 the hat of an artist (The Visual Designer),
#4 the hat of a writer,
#5 the hat of a security specialist and
   the hat of a futurist, which contains all the previous hats (skills).
Maybe in future I will be wearing a few of this hats.
But, now I am only a beginner. That's why I think, I would like to wear the hat #1 - the hat of an engineer.
